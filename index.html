        "Ropa Vieja", a dish that dates back to the Middle Ages in Spanish cuisine, is one of the most popular and loved dishes in Cuba. This dish is called "ropa vieja" in Spanish, which means "old clothes", and it is said to have originated when a poor man, with nothing more than his "old clothes", cut and cooked them. As he cooked the clothes, his love for his family turned them into meat, and thus was born this delicious dish.

        As for sweets, "Arroz con Leche" is a popular dessert not only in Cuba, but in many countries in Latin America. The Cuban version of this rice pudding often includes ingredients like lemon peel or coconut grated.
