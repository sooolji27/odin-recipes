Hello! This is a recipe project that I have created as part of my learning in The Odin Project. It is a small adventure in which I have used HTML to build a website that focuses on sharing my most famous Cuban recipes. I hope you enjoy exploring the recipes and that you find something you like! If you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave a message at my email soljicharon@gmail.com
